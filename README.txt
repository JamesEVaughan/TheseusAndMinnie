This is a simple game of Robert Abbott's Theseus and the Minotaur, originally a pen-and-paper 
logic maze.

This is my first prject of real size that will be built in stages before being feature complete. 

It will also be my first foray using a Model-View-Controller setup for a program. For 
simplicity's sake I've decided to design things in a more specific (rather than generic) manner.
This will allow me to focus on the interactions between the Model, View, and Controller directly,
instead of getting caught up with early stae planning.


The following section will be updated as features enter various stages of completeness.
